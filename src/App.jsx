 adjacent teeth (or other teeth on that side)\n               ○​ draw a little picture of the teeth & the contacts you see → at the end, you can compare post-op occlusion to pre-op\n                    occlusion (especially making sure occlusion on adjacent teeth is the same)\n     4.​ remove the sprue from the restoration\n               ○​ hold the restoration (do not hold the block) — when removing the sprue, the block may fly away (preventing the\n                    restoration from flying away)\n               ○​ use the diamond disk (in the red provisional bur block) to segment cut the sprue to separate the restoration & the\n                    block (do not damage the restoration)\n               ○​ use the pink/red colored disc to remove the remainder of the sprue & smooth the remaining area\n     5.​ place Isodry\n               ○​ use Isodry to keep the area dry & prevent aspiration of the restoration\n     6.​ remove provisional\n               ○​ for Integrity provisionals:\n                        ■​ first use your fingers to see if provisional is loose/easily removed\n                        ■​ if you can’t get the provisional off with your hands alone, try using a hemostat — don’t use too much force\n                             or you might damage the provisional (and if the permanent restoration doesn’t fit, you’ll have to make a\n                             new provisional)\n                        ■​ if you can’t get the provisional off with a hemostat, use a sickle scaler to very gently loosen the provisional\n                             at the margins — take great care not to damage the margins or the final restoration won’t fit — then use a\n                             hemostat\n                        ■​ clean cement with a scaler\n               ○​ for Telio:\n                        ■​ use a sharp hatchet to wiggle & loosen the Telio — it usually comes out in a big piece\n               ○​ clean tooth with prophy angle & pumice (not prophy paste with fluoride)\n     7.​ try restoration in\n               ○​ use floss to evaluate interproximal contacts — hold the restoration with your finger so you don’t dislodge it\n               ○​ evaluate margins with an explorer\n     8.​ if restoration doesn’t fit\n               ○​ adjust interproximal contacts first\n                        ■​ the most common cause for a restoration failing to seat all the way is too tight of interproximal contacts\n                        ■​ mark the interproximal contacts with articulating paper → adjust restoration with burs → see if\n                             restoration fits now\n               ○​ then, adjust prep as needed:\n                        ■​ mark intaglio of restoration:\n                                  ●​ lay articulating paper over prep → seat restoration on top of articulating paper into prep\n                                  ●​ spray FitChecker into intaglio of restoration → seat restoration into prep\n                        ■​ adjust preparation accordingly\n                                  ●​ round sharp edges of the preparation, or anywhere where there is marking from articulating\n                                      paper / FitChecker\n     9.​ evaluate esthetics\n               ○​ ask patient if they are happy with esthetics — shape, size, & color\n\n10.​ check in — have instructor check restoration\n11.​ take bitewing\n          ○​ take a bitewing (PA for anterior teeth) to verify full seating & closed margins (before cementation)\n12.​ adjust occlusion\n          ○​ use articulating paper to evaluate occlusion\n          ○​ use different color articulating paper to evaluate excursive movements\n          ○​ use ceramic burs to adjust occlusion now extraorally (before cementation)\n13.​ adjust contours\n          ○​ adjust contours as needed\n14.​ polish\n          ○​ use the e.max polishing burs in correct sequence to polish the restoration before crystallizing\n15.​ clean & crystallize\n          ○​ remove all articulating paper marks\n          ○​ soak restoration in a cup of Cavicide for 1 minute\n          ○​ rinse restoration & put it in a cup of water\n          ○​ bring to Dan for crystallization (25 min)\n16.​ try in crystallized restoration\n          ○​ re-confirm interproximal contacts, margins, & occlusion\n17.​ cement

— check to see if hemostasis is achieved now; it should be! if you remove wet cotton pellets\n                         and pulp is still profusely bleeding, you likely haven’t removed all of the coronal pulp tissue or the\n                         radicular pulp is inflamed/infected and the tooth will likely require complete pulpectomy\n                    ■​ next, plug the pulp chamber with a cotton pellet soaked in Viscostat (unit-dose syringes in clinic)\n7.​ check in — have instructor check pulpotomy\n8.​ place IRM\n           ○​ restore the pulp chamber with IRM approximately up to the level of the preparation\n                    ■​ IRM should be well adapted to the floor to completely seal the chamber\n           ○​ use a wet cotton applicator to adapt IRM\n9.​ check in — have instructor check IRM placement\n10.​ complete SSC prep\n           ○​ first, reduce occlusion with diamond football bur\n                    ■​ 1.5 - 2.0 mm occlusal clearance from opposing tooth\n                    ■​ maintain the general occlusal anatomy\n           ○​ reduce the interproximals with knife-edge finish line (no shoulder, no ledge)\n                    ■​ 0.5 mm of interproximal clearance — explorer should easily pass\n                    ■​ proximal reduction should converge 4-10° total (2-5° per side)\n                    ■​ proximal reduction should follow tooth form (rounded)\n                    ■​ knife-edge finish line should be at gingival margin or slightly subgingival\n                    ■​ buccal & lingual reduction is usually not indicated (except for decay removal) — ask instructor\n           ○​ bevel the buccal & lingual and round sharp corners/edges\n                    ■​ 30-40° bevel is ideal\n                    ■​ the reason for the bevel is to return the cusp tips to their original position after occlusal reduction\n           ○​ if caries is larger than expected or if you are close to the pulp, check with instructor\n11.​ fit SSC (do not cement)\n           ○​ place a throat pack / use gauze to prevent swallowing or aspiration\n           ○​ select a stainless steel crown from the kit that approximates the anatomy & size of the tooth\n           ○​ seat the crown on the lingual then roll/snap to the buccal\n                    ■​ you want a super tight fit so it’ll require a lot of pressure to get the crown to seat\n           ○​ remove the crown then use contouring pliers to crimp the crown (adapt crown to tooth under gingival margin)\n           ○​ stainless steel crowns are not adjustable, so you are limited in fine-tuning occlusion\n                    ■​ the pediatric dentition is adaptable to changes in occlusion of less than 0.5 mm\n12.​ check in — have instructor check crown preparation & crown fit\n13.​ cement SSC\n           ○​ fill crown 80% with FujiCem\n           ○​ seat lingual & roll to buccal\n           ○​ have patient bite on bite stick to fully seat crown\n           ○​ remove excess cement with microbrushes\n           ○​ floss\n           ○​ have patient bite on cotton roll for 3 minutes\n14.​ check in — have instructor check your restoration\n15.​ complete codes & note\n           ○​ D3230 (Ant -- primary tooth)\n           ○​ D3240 (Post -- primary tooth)\n           ○​ D2930 (Prefab SS crown -- prim. tooth)\n16.​ check in — have instructor check final restoration\n           ○​ have instructor swipe your EPR/codes/note"

  //       \n followed by a dash, em-dash, digit, capital letter, or bullet —

 * MEE PROGRESS — top of the RVUs tab.
 *
 * Designed to answer one question on first glance: "where am I, and what
 * do I need to do?" Layout:
 *
 *   - VERDICT (always visible if data entered): single sentence summary —
 *     how many categories below D3, how many RVUs left to D4 across all.
 *
 *   - ACTION ITEMS: only categories where the student is below D4. Sorted
 *     biggest gap first. Each row shows current/D3/D4, gap, progress bar,
 *     and the top few high-RVU codes that count toward closing the gap.
 *
 *   - COMPLETED: categories already at D4 collapse to a single line.
 *
 *   - UPDATE FORM (collapsed by default): edit numbers, with +/- buttons
 *     for quick increment after a clinic session.

 *   1. TIMELINE — horizontal strip showing all 26 PEs positioned in their

 *      Color-coded: oxblood (past), gold (current), neutral (future). The
 *      "current" semester is determined by the date — see CURRENT_SEMESTER.
 *
 *   2. PE LIBRARY — cards grouped by Part (Perio, Restorative Foundation, etc.).
 *      Each card collapsed by default showing code, name, deadline, and

 *
 *   3. EXPANDED CARD — full detail: objectives, prerequisite, case selection,

 *
 * The eligibility badge connects to the MEE counts already saved in

 * shows "Eligible" or "Need X more [thing]". For fuzzy prereqs (PE-completion
 * gates, mixed counts), shows just the prerequisite text.
